# FSTogglExport
F# version of the Toggl export tool

Gets time entries with the project info and writes them into a CSV file
that can easily be copy-pasted into a time management system that uses spreadsheets.

Current version just reads the data.
*This is work in progress!*

Future roadmap of features:
* Print time entries to terminal instead of a file
* Importing of time entries directly to e.g. Google Spreadsheets or Office 365
